#### AWS Elastic Mapreduce (EMR)

AWS EMR is a distributed framework that will handle big data, like other big data tools  Apache Hive, Hadoop, Sparkâ€¦.

You can read more about that [HERE](https://www.bing.com/search?pglt=929&q=AWS+Elastic+Mapreduce+(EMR)&gs_lcrp=EgRlZGdlKgYIABBFGDkyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRhA0gEHODE1ajBqMagCALACAA&PC=WSEDSE). In short, it is a tools that can contain multiple **clusters**, a **cluster** can contain multiple nodes or compute units, and each of them could crunch a portion of the data and then bring it all together to produce results. With this kind of framework we could handle **BIG DATA** (like hundreds of Terabytes).

AWS EMR is used in wide range of big data tasks:
+ data ingestion
+ data processing
+ data transformation 
+ data Analasis
+ machine learning 
+ Spark streaming (Real-time data)


- AWS EMR is also highly scalable (easy to add or remove nodes to their cluster)
- Various security features, such as encryption for data in transit and at rest, and fine-grained access control.
- EMR can integrates with other AWS services, and can be easily used in conjunction with other AWS big data services, such as Amazon Redshift and Amazon Athena.
- EMR also provides various management and monitoring tools, such as Amazon CloudWatch, AWS CloudTrail, and AWS Management Console, to help users manage and monitor their big data workflows.

#### Hive vs Spark
2 of the most used tools right now to process big data is hive and spark , but spark is recently gain more and more popularity, beating hive in many cases (eg. Speed). 
| Spark                                                                                                             | Hive                                                                        |

| Data warehousing system for querying and analyzing large datasets stored in Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) | Spark, on the other hand, is a fast and flexible big data processing engine |
| Designed for batch processing and is optimized for long-running queries over large data sets.                     | Batch and real-time processing workloads.                                   |
| Very stable                                                                                                       | Steeper learning curve, especially coming from SQL                          |
| Easier to learn since Hive Query Language (HQL) is very similar to SQL                                            | Multi-language support including Python, Scala, Java                        |

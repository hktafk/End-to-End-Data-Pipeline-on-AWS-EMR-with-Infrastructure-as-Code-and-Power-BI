#### Short description
We have a dataset here that we going to be using to analyze . This is a genetic sale data from some company that operates all around the world.

But there is something critical to consider. Both `order_date` and `ship date`, you‚Äôll notice the data would be a little bit corrupted (eg. 10/18/2014, 11-07-2021). We‚Äôll do transformation later to fix this.

#### üìä1.Dataset Overview
This dataset contains 1,000 individual sales transactions recorded between January 1, 2010 and July 26, 2017 for a global consumer-goods company. It captures key information on products sold, geographic markets, order/ship dates, sales channels, and financial metrics (revenue, cost, profit).

Use Cases & Business Goals:

- Revenue & Profit Analysis: Understand which regions, products, and channels drive the most revenue and profit.

- Supply-Chain & Lead-Time Optimization: Measure order-to-ship delays and identify opportunities to reduce fulfillment times.

- Demand Forecasting & Inventory Planning: Analyze historical sales patterns by item type and region to build predictive models.

- Priority & Channel Strategy: Evaluate how order priority (e.g. ‚ÄúHigh‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúLow‚Äù) and sales channel (Online vs. Offline) impact overall performance.

#### 2. Business Requirement
The primary objective is to demonstrate an end-to-end data engineering and analytics workflow:

- Ingestion & ETL

- Extract raw CSV into a data lake

- Transform dates, calculate lead times, and validate financial computations

- Load cleansed data into a relational database or analytics warehouse

- Analytics & Visualization

- Build dashboards (Power BI, Tableau) to monitor key metrics by region, product, channel, and priority

- Implement SQL queries and/or Python scripts to compute rolling averages, growth rates, and outlier detection

- Predictive Modeling

- Train models to forecast monthly sales volume and profit by product category and geography

- Evaluate model performance and integrate into a simple web app (Flask + Electron) for business users

This dataset gives full visibility into both top-line (revenue) and bottom-line (profit) performance, enabling demonstration of data‚Äêdriven decision-making.
